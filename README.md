# Exploring the Weather in Athens

## Questions


### Q1: Obtain the Data

You will work with data covering the period from 1955 to 2020. The data will be obtained from two sources:

* Data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/) and in particular https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search. 

* As we are focusing on Athens, you will use the data from the Hellinikon weather station and you will concentrate on the average daily temperature and precipitation.

* Explore the completeness of the data. What data are missing?

* To fill in any missing data you will use an alternative dataset available from https://data.hellenicdataservice.gr/dataset/66e1c19a-7b0e-456f-b465-b301a1130e3f; this dataset covers only the period from 2010-2019.

### Q2: Deviation of Summer Temperatures

The Hellenic National Meteorological Service has published a report on extreme weather events for 2020. The report is available at http://www.hnms.gr/emy/en/pdf/2020_GRsignificantEVENT_en.pdf. In page 7 of the report there is a graph showing the mean summer temperature deviation from a baseline of 1971-2000.

You will create your own version of the graph, using a baseline of 1974-1999. Your graph should look like the one below. The line that runs through the graph is the 10 years rolling avarege of the deviation from the mean. What is your intepretation of the figure?

### Q3: Evolution of Daily Temperatures

You will get the average temperature for each year for the full period from 1955 to 2020. You will then create a plot showing the daily temperature for each year. The line corresponding to each year will be smoothed by using a 30 days rolling average. The lines are colored from light orange to dark orange, progressing through the years in ascending order.

On that plot you will overlay a line showing the average daily temperature for the baseline period of 1974-1999 (that is the black line). The line will also be smoothed usng a 30 days rolling average. What is your interpretation of the figure?

### Q4: Extreme Temperature Events

Another mesure used by climatologists is the number of extreme events. Extreme events are defined as those beyond 5% or 10% from the expected value. We will deal with extreme heat events going 10% above the baseline.

You will count the number of extreme temperature events per year, compared to the baseline of 1974-1999. You should should produce a graph like the one that follows. The vertical axis is the percentage of extreme heat events calculated over the number of observations for each year. The gray line in the middle is the average percentage of extreme tempearture events of the baseline. The colour blue is used for those years where the percentage is below the baseline; otherwise the colour is orange. What is your interpretation of the graph?

### Q5: Precipitation

Continuing the thread on extreme events, another consideration is rainfall. The weather may or may not be drying up. We are, however, interested in whether precipication becomes more intense over time.

To see that, you will count the overall rainfall over the year and the number of rainy days in each year. Then, by dividing the rainfall by the number of rainy days you will get an indication of whether we are getting rain in more concentrated bursts. You will then create a plot showing the ratio of rainfall over rainy days over the years. On the plot you will overlay the 10 years rolling average. The plot should be similar to the one below. What is your interpretation of the plot?

# Dissecting Spotify Valence

Spotify uses a metric called *valence* to measure the happiness of a track. The metric itself, however, was not developed by Spotify. It was originally developed by Echo Nest, a company that was bought by Spotify in 2014. We don't know exactly how valence is calculated. Some details are given by a blog post, which you can find here:

https://web.archive.org/web/20170422195736/http://blog.echonest.com/post/66097438564/plotting-musics-emotional-valence-1950-2013

Your task is to untangle the mystery behind valence and propose how this is derived.

Spotify offers the following information that may be relevant to your task:

* [Get Track's Audio Features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features) and [Get Tracks' Audio Features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-several-audio-features).

* [Get Track's Audio Analysis](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-analysis).

To tackle the problem you can use the Spotify charts data from Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2594556, but you are not limitted to that. In fact you are encouraged to use additional data that you may find, or get yourself.

The rank of your assignment will contribute to the grade. That is, if $x$ is the unranked grade of an assignment and $r$ is the respective modelâ€™s ranking among $n$ students according to Q2 below, then the final grade will be computed as $0.75x + 2.5[1 - (r-1)/(n-1)]$. 

The ranking will be performed on a test dataset that will be provided in due course. The rank metrics will be Mean Average Error (MAE).

## Questions


### Q1: Expore which Track Features Influence Valence

You will use inferential statistic methods to study how track features influence valence. You must find the best possible model for explaining the valence based on the features that you find significant.

### Q2: Predict Valence

Use Machine Learning techniques to predict valence based on track features:

* You will use at least three different methods. For each methods you should ensure that you tune your hyperparameters as best as you can.

* Once you identify the best method and hyperparameters, explain, to the extent that is possible, which features influence the valence metric.

* You will evaluate your predictions on a holdout testing dataset that will be provided to you. Your evaluation and the value of the MAE on the holdout testing dataset must be included at the end of your submission.
